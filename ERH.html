							<p>The aim of the project was to centralize operational risk data in order to facilitate a holistic view with a common reporting source and methodology, thereby enabling the risk management organization and the line of business to gain a comprehensive understanding of the operational risks.</p>
							<p>The task of an ETL developer included : </p>
							<p>The responsibilities of an ETL developer entailed comprehending the provided source-to-target mappings and creating code to implement them, verifying the functionality of the developed code through testing, providing the test results, and executing the code to extract, transform, and load the data.</p>
							<h3>Individual contribution</h3>
							<p>I have created a linux script to help automate the file validation process.
								In a Linux environment, it is common to use scripts to automate various tasks, including ETL workflows for data processing. Before loading data into a target system, it is important to ensure that the data is properly formatted and mapped according to the target system's requirements. To achieve this, a Linux script can be used to check the column names of the source CSV files against the ETL source definition in the mapping.
								As part of our data integration process, we have developed a Linux script to ensure the consistency of the column names in the source CSV files with the ETL source definition in the mapping before loading into the data warehouse. This is a critical step to ensure the accuracy and integrity of the data being loaded.
The script is designed to run automatically prior to the ETL workflow load process. It checks the column names in the source CSV files against the expected column names defined in the ETL mapping. If the column names in the source CSV files do not match with the expected column names in the ETL mapping, the script will flag an error and stop the load process.
The linux script reads in the source CSV files and the ETL mapping file (Master file) and performs a comparison of the column names. If there are any mismatches, the script generates an error log file with a detailed explanation of the issues.
The script also allows for some customization by defining different parameters for the data validation, such as specifying the location of the source CSV files and the ETL mapping file.
