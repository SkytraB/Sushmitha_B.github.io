							<p>The aim of the project is to enhance financial transparency across all technology and operations services through the establishment of a well-defined service hierarchy. This will involve the development of models for accurately calculating the actual service costs, and providing access to analytical tools that will enable the setting of service prices.</p>
							<p>As a member of the Management Information Systems (MIS) team in the banking sector, my role has entailed working as an Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) developer. Specifically, I have been involved in the processing of costing data for the purpose of calculating actual service costs. Additionally, I have been responsible for facilitating access to these costs for analysis purposes, ultimately aiding in the determination of service pricing.</p>
							<h3>Individual contributions</h3>
							<p>While working on the project, I executed all code modifications, generated all necessary packages, and transferred code independently. This undertaking was comparable to a full cycle in the company. Parallelly I worked on an upgrade mini project. Additionally, I undertook supplementary projects on my own, obtained a better understanding of code logic and data, and autonomously created procedures in Oracle, as well as numerous Linux scripts. Consequently, I was able to communicate issues more effectively with my superior. Furthermore, I fostered a sense of dependability among my colleagues and provided training to several junior team members.</p>
